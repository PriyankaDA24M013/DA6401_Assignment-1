# DA6401_Assignment-1

The flow of the code is as follows:
1. Run sweep.py to find the best hyperparameters.
2. Use the best hyperparameters to train the model for more epochs using train.py


Supporting Files:

1.dataset.py: Loads and preprocesses the dataset.

2.activation.py: Provides activation functions and their derivatives.

3.loss.py: Implements loss functions and their derivatives.

4.model.py: Defines the FeedForwardNN class for the neural network.

5.optimizer.py: Implements various optimizers (SGD, Momentum, NAG, RMSprop, Adam, Nadam).

6.utils.py: Contains utility functions like accuracy, one_hot_encode, and initialize_weights
